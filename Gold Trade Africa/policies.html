									<p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">A Gold Trade Africa insurance policy can offer you the protection you need. <br><br>

We offer a range of products to protect your precious metals and bullion investments. Our policies include insurance against theft, loss, and damage. Moreover, they are designed to meet the needs of the growing market for precious and semi-precious metals.<br><br>

<strong>The Exclusions </strong><br>Exclusions take coverage away from the Insuring Agreement. The three major types of Exclusions are:<br><br>
°Excluded perils or causes of loss<br><br>
°Excluded losses<br><br>
°Excluded property<br><br>
Typical examples of excluded perils under a homeowners policy are flood, earthquake, and nuclear radiation. A typical example of an excluded loss under an automobile policy is damage due to wear and tear. Examples of excluded property under a homeowners policy are personal property such as an automobile, a pet, or an airplane.<br><br>

<strong>The Conditions</strong> <br>

Conditions are provisions inserted in the policy that qualify or place limitations on the insurer’s promise to pay or perform. If the policy conditions are not met, the insurer can deny the claim. Common conditions in a policy include the requirement to file a proof of loss with the company, to protect property after a loss, and to cooperate during the company’s investigation or defense of a liability lawsuit.<br><br>

<strong>Definitions</strong> <br>Most policies have a Definitions section, which defines specific terms used in the policy. It may be a stand-alone section or part of another section. In order to understand the terms used in the policy, it is important to read this section.<br><br>

<strong>Endorsements and Riders</strong> <br>An insurer may change the language or coverage of a policy at the time of the policy renewal. Endorsements and Riders are written provisions that add to, delete, or modify the provisions in the original insurance contract. In most states, the insurer is required to send you a copy of the changes to your policy. It is important that you read all Endorsements or Riders so you understand how your policy has changed and if the policy is still adequate to meet your needs.</p>
